The partners areworking together to promote the development and implementation of green infrastructure by exchanging experience and expertise, and by identifying, analysing and transferring good practice related to green infrastructure policies. The project’s main objective is to strengthen the development and implementation of green infrastructure in EU regions. This objective will be achieved by exchanging and disseminating expertise, experience and best practices among the partners, in relation both to green infrastructure in general and to its development and implementation in four specific fields: urban areas; natural areas; rural land use; and climate change adaptation. Green infrastructure brings biodiversity conservation into harmonywith other forms of land use by strengthening the coherence of ecosystems, at the same time contributing to climate changemitigation and adaptation and reducing vulnerability to natural disasters. Green infrastructure places biodiversity conservationwithin a broader policy framework,where its objectives can be achieved in the context of other land-use objectives, such as those related to agriculture, forestry, recreation and climate change.</p>
